# How to Contribute


1. **Setup Your Codebase**:
   - **Fork** the repository to your GitHub account and copy it's clone URL
   - **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine using [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git) (make sure it's installed)

   For this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:homebrew-ec-foss/prob.lm.git
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**
   
   - Make a **separate branch before making changes** (this will help us prevent merge conflicts)

    - Feel free to reach out to the mentors whenever you face an issue. Please don't try to fix it on your own if you are not sure!

4. **Commit and Push**:
   Commit your changes and push them to your fork:

   ```bash
   # make sure your changes are clearly mention
   git commit -m "Describe the changes you made"
   git push origin <your-branch-name>

   ex: git push origin new-change-branch
   ```
   Alternatively, use VSCode's inbuilt Git source control pane `Ctrl+Shift+G` if you're uncomfortable with a CLI

5. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   - After pushing your changes, open a pull request to pull changes from your fork to the original repository.
    - Describe what changes you have made in the description of your PR 

6. **Get Feedback**
   Wait for a mentor to review your pull request (PR) and provide feedback.

NOTE: **MAKE SURE YOU ARE WORKING ON A SEPARATE BRANCH BEFORE MAKING CHANGES. DO NOT WORK ON `main` or `master`**
